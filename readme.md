# What is this?

### This program takes an incorrect state code and will replace it with the correct state code

# Why should I use this?

### Certain old codes ex.00007/00010 contain many zeros rendering the find and replace method tedious to do manually

# How do I use this?

### Have the internal folder and the ItemReplace.exe in the same folder as the sales file you want to modify
### open the exe and the window will prompt for the old and new code, enter the full 5 digit code. the program will run and close automatically. At this point the modification has been completed.

# Known issues

### due to how this programs gathers the .TXT file having multiple files with the .TXT extension in the same directory will likely cause issues
